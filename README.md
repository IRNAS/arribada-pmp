## Key user stories - v2
1. Penguin camera - Install on a pole in Antarctica. Arrive at location and turn on. Push button for test mode. See images via WiFi on smartphone or leave running and remove USB. To check camera alignment and correct operation. Leave device running for year or more, come pack and swap USB flash drive. Meanwhile real-time reporting via Lora or Lacuna, each day.
1. River camera - Install above a river with ultrasonic sensor and optional rockblock connection. Once above river enable the test mode via bluetooth. Check via WiFi the alignment and operation. Leave running and get real time sensor data. retrieve in a year to get back the photos.
1. TBD

## Configurable parameters - settings - v2
All the setings are defined as Environmental vairables in Linux, settings are changed using one of the following methods: json file present on the USB flash drive, system auto-updates values from it, via lora or via Balena if used

* User definable parameters:
 * capture schedule per month:
   * start time (UTC) - daily - fixed hour or `sunrise` (default 0:00)
   * end time (UTC) - daily - fixed hour or `sunset`(default 23:59)
   * interval (in minutes) - 0 to 24*60 (default 60)
 * location (automatic if GPS present):
   * lat (used for sunrise/sunset calculation)
   * lon (used for sunrise/sunset calculation)
 * capture type:
   * image
    * flash config
   * video
 * pira variables:
   * all timer values and defaults
   * lora parameters
   * rockblock parameters
   * sensor reporting interval
 * battery settings:
   * empty: default 10% - do not wake up the RPi below that
   * low-battery: default 30% - wake up only once a day
   * normal: general operation
